RegNet
==========


### Introduction
In this paper we propose a method to solve nonrigid image registration through a learning approach, instead of via iterative optimization of a predefined dissimilarity metric. We design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture that, in contrast to all other work, directly estimates the displacement vector field (DVF) from a pair of input images. The proposed RegNet is trained using a large set of artificially generated DVFs, does not explicitly define a dissimilarity metric, and integrates image content at multiple scales to equip the network with contextual information. At testing time nonrigid registration is performed in a single shot, in contrast to current iterative methods.
