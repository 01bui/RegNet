RegNet
==========


## Introduction
In this paper we propose a method to solve nonrigid image registration through a learning approach, instead of via iterative optimization of a predefined dissimilarity metric. We design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture that, in contrast to all other work, directly estimates the displacement vector field (DVF) from a pair of input images. The proposed RegNet is trained using a large set of artificially generated DVFs, does not explicitly define a dissimilarity metric, and integrates image content at multiple scales to equip the network with contextual information. At testing time nonrigid registration is performed in a single shot, in contrast to current iterative methods.

## 2. Running RegNet
Run either 'RegNet2D_MICCAI.py' or RegNet3D_MICCAI.py. Please note that current RegNet only works with 3D images and the script RegNet2D_MICCAI.py extracts 2D slices from a 3D image.

### 2.1 Data
Images are read and written by SimpleITK.
